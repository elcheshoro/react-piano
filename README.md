# react-piano

A piano recording app written in React.

## Prerequisites

* yarn

## Setup

* `yarn`

## Commands

* `yarn start` - Opens the site in the browser and runs a local web server. Includes hot reload.

* `yarn build` - Performs a production build to the `build` folder.

* `yarn lint` - Runs eslint on the code displaying any linting errors.

* `yarn test` - Runs the unit tests.

## Possible future improvements

* Covert project to TypeScript for better type safety.

* Create an API to store the songs rather than local storage.

* Find a more performant way to store and play songs which avoids using `setInterval`.
